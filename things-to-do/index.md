## Things To Do

### Stay in and spend time with your group

Most people visit us with a large list of places to visit and things to do, however more than a few decide the surroundings are so pleasant that just relaxing with friends and family in the church is all they want to do. Stay in, play snooker or use the sauna and relax.

### Go walking (dog optional) or cycling

Walk out the front door and join the short Wilsontown Glen Walk or go five minutes further on and explore what’s left of Wilsontown Ironworks (now a Scheduled ancient monument) or go a bit further still and look around Heathland Forest. There are plenty of other walking opportunities nearby including  West Forth Woodland and Woodmuir Forest.  Nearly all of these areas provide relatively gentle walking with some basic mountain biking runs. For a longer cycle try the Forth, Wilsontown,Braehead Cycle Route.If you want something a little more strenuous walking climb Tinto Hill, or if mountain biking is more your thing, you can’t go far wrong with Glentress...its mountain bike heaven. There are plenty more mountain runs, but this one should keep even the keenest happy for a while and its under 50 minutes away.
