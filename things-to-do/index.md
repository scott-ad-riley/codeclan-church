## Things To Do

### Golfing

The Church at the Old Manse is ideal for golfing groups.

With more than twenty courses within a half hour drive from us, the variety of course settings available is fantastic. Whether its the Dalmahoy Country Club, Livingston Deer Park Golf and Bowling or the local clubs of Lanark, Carnwath, Biggar, Shotts, Greenburn or Harburn there is a selection of courses and activities to keep you and your group amused.

Slightly further afield St Andrews, Loch Lomond, Troon and North Berwick are around 80 minutes away while Muirfield and Gleneagles are 60 minutes away.

### Go walking (dog optional) or cycling

Walk out the front door and join the short Wilsontown Glen Walk or go five minutes further on and explore what’s left of Wilsontown Ironworks (now a Scheduled ancient monument) or go a bit further still and look around Heathland Forest. There are plenty of other walking opportunities nearby including  West Forth Woodland and Woodmuir Forest. Nearly all of these areas provide relatively gentle walking with some basic mountain biking runs. For a longer cycle try the Forth, Wilsontown and Braehead Cycle Route. If you want something a little more strenuous you can climb Tinto Hill, or if mountain biking is more your thing, you can’t go far wrong with Glentress...it's mountain bike heaven. There are plenty more mountain runs, but this one should keep even the keenest happy for a while and its under 50 minutes away.

### Stay in and spend time with your group

Most people visit us with a large list of places to visit and things to do, however more than a few decide the surroundings are so pleasant that just relaxing with friends and family in the church is all they want to do. Stay in, play snooker or use the sauna and relax.
