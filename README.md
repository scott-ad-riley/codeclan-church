# Church Rebuild/Codeclan project

**work paused on this site until I have completed the 1 or 2 page basic portfolio site**

##Â Description/Outline

I've built the site with Jekyll to allow me to easily host and port the project around. I've used the SASS default preprocessor built-in to jekyll and deliberately built the site and interactions without any other js lib or plugins (including jQuery) to keep the size to a minimum. 

Building the site with Jekyll as mentioned above means that by simply creating a gh-pages branch, I can host the site at http://scott-ad-riley.github.io/codeclan-church

To test/create the site locally, just git clone and then run jekyll serve from the root. You will need ot have jekyll installed on you marchine - I have been using Jekyll v3.0.1 with Ruby v2.2.3.
